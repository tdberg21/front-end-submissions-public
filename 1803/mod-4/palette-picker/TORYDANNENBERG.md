## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

Yes.

#### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?

None.

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
happy code- scripts lines 134-139:
```const fetchSavedProjects = async () => {
  const url = '/api/v1/projects/';
  const response = await fetch(url);
  const results = await response.json();
  return results;
};```

I think it shows the growth of my comfort with coding throughout Turing. In mod1 my functions were usually much longer and handled multiple tasks but I was much more successful in writing DRY SRP functions. 

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
sad code- scripts lines 75-79:
```<div class="mini-color-boxes mini-color-box1" style="background-color: ${colors[0]}" title="${colors[0]}"></div>
      <div class="mini-color-boxes mini-color-box2" style="background-color: ${colors[1]}" title="${colors[1]}"></div>
      <div class="mini-color-boxes mini-color-box3" style="background-color: ${colors[2]}" title="${colors[2]}"></div>
      <div class="mini-color-boxes mini-color-box4" style="background-color: ${colors[3]}" title="${colors[3]}"></div>
      <div class="mini-color-boxes mini-color-box5" style="background-color: ${colors[4]}" title="${colors[4]}"></div>```
      
It is very repetitive and just looks ugly. I am sure it could be refactored using an array prototype but I did not have enough time.

#### Link to Design Inspiration

I really liked the look of the 'bold' theme typeface by Rafal Tomal. I think it looks really clean, so I used that as the typeface for my project. I also liked having everything in lowercase, and used that as well. I based my color scheme off of 'Classic Dark,' also from that article.

It was more fun than I expected using jQuery again!
